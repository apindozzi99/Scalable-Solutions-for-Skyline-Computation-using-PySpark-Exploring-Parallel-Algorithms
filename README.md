# Scalable-Solutions-for-Skyline-Computation-using-PySpark-Exploring-Parallel-Algorithms
Algorithms for the parallel computation of the skyline (master thesis).

Here's a synthetic and clear pointed list of the objectives and contributions of this thesis.

• Comprehensive Exploration of existing methodologies in the parallel computing domain, focusing on state-of-the-art applications tailored to skyline computation.
• Efficiency Evaluation of parallel computing tools across various experimental setups
• Empirical Assessment of Optimization Strategies aimed at optimizing the performance of skyline computation algorithms in a parallel computing environment.
• Rigorously validate the proposed approaches using a diverse set of datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios
• Ensure the robustness and applicability of the developed approach in practical, varied contexts through the validation process.
• Identify potential avenues for further improvement based on the experimental results.

The experiments were conducted on a robust computational infrastructure comprising four virtual machines, each equipped with 30 cores and 8GB of RAM. These machines are interconnected via a Spark cluster, enabling us to leverage the collective computational power of 120 cores and over 30GB of RAM for executing parallel computations.
